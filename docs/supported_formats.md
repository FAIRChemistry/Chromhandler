# Data prerequisites

## Data organization

chromatopy strives to simplify the data import and processing of chomatographic time-course data. Therefore, the data should be organized in the following way to be compatible with the tool:

__Time-course data__  

- All data files of a time-course series should be stored within a single folder.
- For Agilent `*.D` directories, these should be stored within a single folder.

__Calibration data__  

- The set of calibration data files should be stored within a single folder.
- For Agilent `*.D` directories, these should be stored within a single folder.

!!! warning
    The files within a folder should be named in a way that allows alphabetical sorting to represent the chronological or logical order of the data. E.g. naming time-course data by reaction time or calibration data by concentration.

## Supported data formats

### Agilent

Due to differing contents within the `*.D` directories of Agilent output files, only agilent system which produce `REPORT.TXT` or `result.csv` files are supported. The mentioned files should be similar to the following example:
