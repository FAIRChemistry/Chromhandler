# Data Preparation

## 📂 Data organization

`chromatopy` requires a specific organization of the measurement data of a time-course or calibration series. The scope of one analysis run is therefore eighter a single sample which is measured over time or a calibration series with multiple samples for different concentrations. 

!!! example
    An exemplary consisting of calibration mensurements and time-course data should be organized as follows:
    ```
    📂 Project
    │
    ├── 📂 Calibration
    │   ├── abts_1uM.json
    │   ├── abts_50uM.json
    │   └── abts_300uM.json
    │
    └── 📂 B002
        ├── B002_12h.json
        ├── B002_24h.json
        └── B002_36h.json
    ```
### Calibration data

- The set of calibration data files should be stored within a single folder.
- Deposit the concentration including the unit in the file name. E.g. `abts_1uM.json` `abts_50uM.json` `abts_300uM.json`. In this case the concentration can be automatically extracted from the file name.

### Time-course data

- All data files of a time-course series should be stored within a single folder.
- Name the folder after your sample ID. E.g. `B002`.
- Deposit the reaction time including the unit in the file name. E.g. `B002_12h.json` `B002_24h.json` `B002_36h.json`. This allows to automatically extract the reaction time and unit from the file name.




## 🔧 Supported Formats

Most output data from chromatographic devices is vendor-specific and proprietary. However, [OpenChrom](https://lablicate.com/platform/openchrom), an open-source software that is free for academic use, provides the tools to convert proprietary data from almost all vendors into a vendor-neutral and machine-readable format, specifically the Allotrope Simple Model (ASM). A complete list of supported formats for pre-processing with OpenChrom can be found [here](https://www.openchrom.net/).

Peak detection and integration with subsequent export to the ASM format is the recommended way to prepare data for subsequent processing with `chromatopy`. For information on how to batch process chromatographic data with OpenChrom, please refer to the section [Spectrum Processing with OpenChrom](#spectrum-processing-with-openchrom-from-lablicate).

### Allotrope Simple Model

!!! info
    The [Allotrope Simple Model (ASM)](https://www.allotrope.org/asm) is a JSON-based and vendor-independent format for analytical data. It is designed to store chromatographic measurement data.

The ASM format is the preferred format for data import. It can be exported from OpenChrom and contains the measured signal and data of all peaks which were processed by OpenChrom. The format is supported by `chromatopy` and can be imported directly.

### Vendor specific formats

As an alternative to the ASM format, `chromatopy` supports the import of chromatographic data from various vendors.  Samples of all supported formats are provided below.

## 🌈 Spectrum Processing with OpenChrom (from Lablicate)

!!! info
    [OpenChrom](https://lablicate.com/platform/openchrom) is an open‑source application for chromatography, spectrometry and spectroscopy. It natively imports data from most GC/MS, GC/FID, HPLC‑DAD and related instruments, offers high‑throughput batch processing (baseline correction, peak detection/integration, reporting) and exports results to the vendor‑independent Allotrope Simple Model (ASM) format—ready for use with `chromatopy`.

### Installation & plug‑in setup

1. Download the current OpenChrom release from the [official site](https://www.openchrom.net/download) and install it.
2. Activate the [Allotrope Simple Model (ASM) plugin](https://lablicate.com/marketplace/extensions/allotrope) (free for academic use) to export the data in the ASM format.
3. Add import converters – in OpenChrom choose `Plug‑ins ➜ Install Converters`, search for your vendor (e.g. *Agilent*, *Waters*, *Shimadzu*) and install the matching plug‑ins.  
   For ASM export, search for **asm** and install the *Allotrope Simple Model* plug‑in.

### Batch processing

1. Open OpenChrom and navigate to `Chromatogram` > `Batch Process`.

2. A new window will open, where you need to specify a new _Project_. Afterwards, a name for the _Batch Process_ can be defined.

3. Now the _Chromatogram Batch Process_ mode needs to be defined. Depending on you data, one of the following modes can be selected. The processing might fail if the wrong mode is selected.
    - `WSD`: Wavelength Spectrum Data
    - `MSD`: Mass Spectrum Data
    - `CSD`
    - `VSD`

4. Now a _Batch Job_ window is opened. The window is divided into the left side, where files can be added, and the right side, where the processing steps can be defined.

5. Add the files you want to process by clicking on the :material-plus: icon in the bottom of the left side. The files can be selected from the file system.

6. Add proccessing steps by clicking on the :material-plus: icon in the bottom of the right side. The following steps are recommended for peak processing and can be added with default parameters:
    - `Baseline Detector` > `SNIP`
    - `Peak Detector` > `First Derivative`
    - `Peak Integrator` > `Peak Integrator Trapezoid`
    - `Chromatogram Export` > `ASM ... (*.json)` then define the output folder.

7. Run the batch process by clicking on the _Execute_ :material-play: icon in the top right corner.

8. After the processing is finished, the data can be imported with chromatopy.

### What if my data cannot be processed with OpenChrom?

If the OpenChrom converter for your data does not work as expected, please check the [OpenChroms Issues](https://github.com/OpenChrom/openchrom/issues), if it is a known issue. If not, consider submitting an issue to the OpenChrom repository.
