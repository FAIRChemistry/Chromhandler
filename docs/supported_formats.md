# Data Preparation

## ðŸ“‚ Data organization

`chromatopy` strives to simplify the data import and processing of chromatographic data. The tool focuses on efficient handling of time-course reaction data, allowing to combine the measured data with data on reaction conditions, concentration calculations and export to the EnzymeML format.  

For this purpose, `chromatopy` requires a specific organization of the measurement data of a time-course or calibration series. The scope of one analysis run is therefore eighter a single chemical sample which is measured over time or a calibration series with multiple samples for different concentrations. 

### Time-course data

- All data files of a time-course series should be stored within a single folder.
- The files within a folder should be named in a way that allows alphabetical sorting to represent the chronological or logical order of the data. E.g. naming time-course data by reaction time or calibration data by concentration. Otherwise, data will be assigned to wrong concentration or time points.

!!! Tip
    Name your files including the corresponding reaction time e.g. `B002_12_h.txt` or `A034.2_5.67min.json` Then the files will be extracted in the correct order and with the correct time unit. In the latter case, the reaction time is `5.67` `min` and alphabetic naming is not necessary. Note that the reaction time unit should be consistent across all files.

### Calibration data

- The set of calibration data files should be stored within a single folder.
- The files need to be named in an alphabetically sortable way to represent the logical order of the data. E.g. naming calibration data by ascending concentration values `abts_001uM.json` `abts_050uM.json` `abts_300uM.json`.
- For calibration data the corresponding concentration cannot be extracted from the file name.

## ðŸ”§ Supported Formats

Most output data from chromatographic devices is vendor-specific and proprietary. However, [OpenChrom](https://lablicate.com/platform/openchrom), an open-source software that is free for academic use, provides the tools to convert proprietary data from almost all vendors into a vendor-neutral and machine-readable format, specifically the Allotrope Simple Model (ASM). A complete list of supported formats for pre-processing with OpenChrom can be found [here](https://www.openchrom.net/).
 

Peak detection and integration with subsequent export to the ASM format is the recommended way to prepare data for subsequent processing with `chromatopy`. For information on how to batch process chromatographic data with OpenChrom, please refer to the section [Spectrum Processing with OpenChrom](#spectrum-processing-with-openchrom-from-lablicate).

### Allotrope Simple Model

!!! info
    The Allotrope Simple Model (ASM) is a JSON-based and vendor-independent format for analytical data. It is designed to store raw and processed data as well as metadata.

The ASM format is the preferred format for data import. It can be exported from OpenChrom and contains the measured signal and data of all peaks which were processed by OpenChrom. The format is supported by `chromatopy` and can be imported directly.

### Vendor specific formats

As an alternative to the ASM format, `chromatopy` supports the import of chromatographic data from various vendors.  Samples of all supported formats are provided below.

## ðŸŒˆ Spectrum Processing with OpenChrom (from Lablicate)

!!! info
    [OpenChrome](https://lablicate.com/platform/openchrom) is tailored for data analysis purposes including processing, visualization and reporting. The implemented batch-processing allows high-throughput evaluation. It can be used for targeted and non-targeted chromatography. A continuously growing portfolio of processing and analysis procedures is provided. Extensions are welcome, as OpenChrom is developed open source and uses a flexible approach, which allows others to implement their own methods, algorithms, filters, detectors, integrators or processors.

Since OpenChrom offers a convenient way to batch-process and export chromatographic data, it is the recommended tool for peak processing prior to data import with chromatopy. 
The following steps showcase how to batch process chromatographic data with OpenChrom, including baseline correction, peak detection and integration, and export to the Allotrope Simple Model (ASM) format. For further information, please refer to the [official documentation of OpenChrom](https://lablicate.com/marketplace/extensions/handbook), which is freely available for academic use.

### Batch processing

If not already done, download and setup OpenChrom as described in the [installation section](installation.md#openchrome-from-lablicate){ data-preview }

1. Open OpenChrom and navigate to `Chromatogram` > `Batch Process`.

2. A new window will open, where you need to specify a new _Project_. Afterwards, a name for the _Batch Process_ can be defined.

3. Now the _Chromatogram Batch Process_ mode needs to be defined. Depending on you data, one of the following modes can be selected. The processing might fail if the wrong mode is selected.
    - `WSD`: Wavelength Spectrum Data
    - `MSD`: Mass Spectrum Data
    - `CSD`
    - `VSD`

4. Now a _Batch Job_ window is opened. The window is divided into the left side, where files can be added, and the right side, where the processing steps can be defined.

5. Add the files you want to process by clicking on the :material-plus: icon in the bottom of the left side. The files can be selected from the file system.
![Batch process steps](pics/select_data.png)

6. Add proccessing steps by clicking on the :material-plus: icon in the bottom of the right side. The following steps are recommended for peak processing and can be added with default parameters:
    - `Baseline Detector` > `SNIP`
    - `Peak Detector` > `First Derivative`
    - `Peak Integrator` > `Peak Integrator Trapezoid`
    - `Chromatogram Export` > `ASM ... (*.json)` then define the output folder.

7. Run the batch process by clicking on the _Execute_ :material-play: icon in the top right corner.
![Batch process steps](pics/batch_setup.png)

8. After the processing is finished, the data can be imported with chromatopy.
