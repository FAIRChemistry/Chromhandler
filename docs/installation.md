## 🖥️ OpenChrome (from Lablicate)

!!! info
    [OpenChrome](https://lablicate.com/platform/openchrom) is an open source software for chromatography, spectrometry and spectroscopy. Its focus is on handling data files from various instruments natively. Hence, chromatographic data, generated by GC/MS, GC/FID, HPLC-DAD and other techniques, may be imported directly, without prior conversion, for subsequent visualization and evaluation.  
    Furthermore, OpenChrom is able to export analyzed data to the JSON-based and vendor-independent, Allotrope Simple Model (ASM) format. This format allows subsequent data processing with `chromatopy` in Python.  

### Download OpenChrom

Download the latest version of OpenChrom from the [official website](https://www.openchrom.net/download).

### Install plug-ins

For reading in data from various vendors, OpenChrom provides a set of plug-ins. For installation, navigate to `Plug-ins` > `Install Converters` in the main menu. Then, type the name of the vendor (e.g., Agilent, Waters, Shimadzu) in the search bar and install the corresponding import plug-ins.   
For later file export, search for `asm` and install the export plug-in.
